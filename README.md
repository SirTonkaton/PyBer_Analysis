# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

The PyBer Analysis involves looking at data from three different city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban. As we will see throughout this project, the city type has a big influence on the overall results for the company. It is important to say that there is opportunity out there to maximize profit and the goal for this data will be to explore those options.

## Analysis 

### PyBer Ride Summary

#### Rural City

This type of city provided the lowest results for the four month period being analyzed. With an average of ~ 32 trips a month, it will safe to assume that our services are being provided once a day. It is up to us to consider whether or not to continue providing this service once we understand the limitations of the rural areas. 

#### Suburban City

As we start to move towards Urban cities, we can determine that the demand for our services starts to increase. On this city type we start approaching five trips per day which totaled $19,356.33 dollars for the time period being analyzed. As revenue, the number of trips and drivers for this type of location grows.

#### Urban City

This type of city reported the highest numbers on all the categories in regards total count. However, when calculating the Average Fare per Ride and the Average Fare per Driver, it is the uderperformer. As we all know, Urban cities have factors such as population, distance between pick up/drop off locations, and amount of drivers that will influence the overall results for the area. Below we present the benefits of having our services on Urban cities where we generated the highest revenue for the company totaling $39,854.38 in the four month period.

The table above gives us the summary of rides provided by PyBer associates in the different city types. As we would expect, Urban citites have the most "Total Rides" and "Drivers" from the period 01/01/2019 through 05/08/2019. Eventhough the time frame being analyzed does not represent an entire year, we can determine that providing such services is profitable regardless of the city type.

The chart below serves as visual aid to help us understrand the current trends:

It will be safe to assume that the company needs to focus on promoting PyBer rides on Rural and Suburban areas. However, that will require a different study to understand the population living in those areas and their current needs. While our goal is to provide more services all around, we still have to consider the fact that the service we provide may not be a need for all areas at this point in time.

## Recommendations

### 1. Population study

The company needs to invest on hiring a third party to do a population study to help us understand the pool of individuals living in each one of the areas: Rural, Suburban and Urban.

### 2. Advertising Budget

Once we obtain the results from the populaton study and if we conclude that there is room to grow on any of the areas, we will need to set an advertising budget to capture the attention of the population to maximize revenue.

### 3. Conduct a Survey

We should conduct multiple surveys on both ends of the equation: the user and the provider. It would be important to get an idea of the why and how we can/should improve within our capabilities. For example, after the survey is conducted we see that the main reason users choose other companies above ours is "waiting time". If that is the case, we can determine that our focus should be on partnering with more drivers to fill the need potential users may have.
